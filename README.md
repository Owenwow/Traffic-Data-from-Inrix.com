## Goal of Project:
Extract data from inrix.com/scorecard/ which is about traffic infromation for over 1300 cities wordwidely.

## Environment:
Python 3.6

## Attention:
Since the html code including traffic data is written in `javascript`, which cannot be downloaded by `request` library, I copyed and pasted useful code into a `coding.txt` file.

## Question:
How can I use `request` library to download code including `javascript`?
