## Goal of Project:
Extract data from inrix.com/scorecard/ which is about traffic infromation for over 1300 cities wordwidely.

## Description:
`soup.txt`: html code pasted from inrix.com (Reason of not using `request` is to prevent future change of Inrix.com)

`script.py`: coding for extracting data from `soup.txt`

`traffic_by_city.py`: Result generated using `script.py`

## Conclusion:
First time using Github.

First project about `BeautifulSoup`, it took me more than 20 hours to complete it.
For a non-CS major student, this project is tough. However, it is good to learn, isn't it?
